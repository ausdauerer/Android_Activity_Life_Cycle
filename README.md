# Android_Activity_Life_Cycle
    Having a hard time trying to understand the life cycle methods of an android activity and when they are called? Bored of just reading plain text about it from textbooks? Here is an simple applcation that allows you to visualise these methods in realtime as you are navigating through this aplication.
    
    As you wander about the application there is a console at the bottom at all times to keep you informed about which lifecycle methods and of which activity was executed at that instant of time.This helps in knowning exactly which lifecycle method is called and at what instant of time.
    
    Happy Learning!!!!
